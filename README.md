# Polly

This is a project submission for Agile Web development at the University of Western Australia by David Adams and Eddie Atkinson.

The idea of this app was to allow people and organisations to more easily organise events by voting on times and dates to possibly run events.
Users will be able to create Polls and vote on them as well as view results of various polls.
